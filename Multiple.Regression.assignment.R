##Question 1: Fit the best multiple regression model to the data in test.pollute.txt using pollution as the response variable

#######################################################################################################

library(readr)
test_pollute <- read_csv("C:/Users/awong/Downloads/zipped/test.pollute.csv")
View(test_pollute)


##EDA

summary(test_pollute)
pairs(test_pollute)
head(test_pollute)

#No NA's in dataset from looking at the table

##Create full model

full.lm <- lm(pollution ~., data = test_pollute)
summary(full.lm)
#Significant variables are temp, industry, population, and maybe wind)
#R squared is .6145
#F Stat: 11.63 on 6 and 34 DF,  p-value: 4.721e-07

##Create partial model with only those variables that were significant

part.lm <- lm(pollution ~ temp + industry + population + wind, data = test_pollute)
summary(part.lm)
#Significant variables are industry, population, and maybe temp
#R squard is .5958, which means we didn't loss a lot of information from taking out rain and wet.days
#F-statistic: 15.74 on 4 and 36 DF,  p-value: 1.553e-07



#Pairs plot for reduced model 
one <- c(rep(1,length(test_pollute$pollution)))
one
X2 <- cbind(pollution = test_pollute$pollution, temp = test_pollute$temp, population = test_pollute$population, industry = test_pollute$industry)
data1 <- cbind(test_pollute$pollution, X2[,-one])
pairs(data1)

##Or the same plot but faster
pairs(X2)



##Check for multicollinearity
cor(X2) ##Industry and population is highly corelated at .95

##So create a model where I only take one of them. I will keep industry instead of population because it's t test pvalue is a lot less than populations


#New full model
new.full.lm <- lm(pollution ~ temp + industry + wind + rain + wet.days, data = test_pollute)
summary(new.full.lm)
#Significant are temp, industry, and maybe wind and rain. 
#Rsquared is .54 
#F-statistic: 10.73 on 5 and 35 DF,  p-value: 2.621e-06

#New reduced model
new.part.lm <- lm(pollution ~ temp + industry + wind + rain , data = test_pollute)
summary(new.part.lm)
#Signifcant are temp, industry, wind, and rain
#R squared is .56 
#F-statistic: 13.73 on 4 and 36 DF,  p-value: 6.798e-07





##Extra sum of Squares (Check to see if partial model is better fit than full model)
anova(new.part.lm, new.full.lm) ##Since p value is above signifant we can say that partial model was better than full model
#Looks like rain and wet.days doesn't contribute significantly to pollution

##Now let's try to find the best model using AIC
library(MASS)
step <- stepAIC(new.full.lm)
step$anova #Same as my reduced model


######## Check residuals

res <- residuals(new.part.lm)
plot(res ~ test_pollute$temp) #Looks random but huge chance of outliers
plot(res ~ test_pollute$industry) #Looks random but huge chance of outliers
plot(res ~ test_pollute$wind) #Looks random but huge chance of outliers

fitted <- predict(new.part.lm)
plot(res~fitted) ##Again look randomly scatter with 2 outliers

qqplot(res, rnorm(length(res))) #Look normal with some crazy outlier 

#Let's try a transformation. 

new.part.lm2 <- lm(log(pollution) ~ temp + industry + wind + rain , data = test_pollute)
summary(new.part.lm2)

#R squared is .5902
#All metrics in model are significant
#F-statistic:  15.4 on 4 and 36 DF,  p-value: 1.971e-07


##Check residuals
res <- residuals(new.part.lm2)
plot(res ~ test_pollute$temp) #Looks random but huge chance of outliers
plot(res ~ test_pollute$industry) #Looks random but huge chance of outliers
plot(res ~ test_pollute$wind) #Looks random but huge chance of outliers

fitted <- predict(new.part.lm2)
plot(res~fitted) ##Again looks good with maybe some outliers

#Conclusion:
#After dealing with multicollinearity, my final model is: new.part.lm2 (Predictors = temp, industry, wind, rain and response is log(pollute))- Best R squared after dealing with multicollinearity
#and is built the same as model with best AIC score, except response variable has been transformed because of some outliers in residual plots.
#It's F test pvalue also says it's significant.

##Full model

full.lm.2 <- lm(Growth.rate ~., data = daphnia)
summary(full.lm.2)
## Significant were clone2 and clone3
## R squared is .3121
## F-statistic: 6.369 on 6 and 65 DF,  p-value: 2.608e-05


##Partial with only clone 2 and clone 3 since they were he ones significant from full model
p.lm.2 <- lm(Growth.rate ~ clone2 + clone3, data = daphnia)
summary(p.lm.2)
## Significant were clone2 and clone3
## R squared is .3151. Some how adjusted R squared increased
## F-statistic: 17.33 on 2 and 69 DF,  p-value: 7.958e-07



##Pairs plot for partial model
X2 <- cbind(Growth.rate = daphnia$Growth.rate,  clone2 = daphnia$clone2, clone3 = daphnia$clone3)
pairs(X2) ##Doesn't show much since categorical. 
## Growth Rate higher in clone2 when compared to others and Growth rate lower in clone 3 when compared to others


##Check multicollinearity
cor(X2) #Nothing seems collinear

##Extra sum of Squares (Check to see if partial model is better fit than full model)

##Check non nested models

##Residual analysis
res <- residuals(p.lm.2)

fitted <- predict(p.lm.2)
plot(res~fitted) ##Not sure if funnel since categorical. Doesn't look like it.

qqplot(res, rnorm(length(res))) #Looks normal

#Conclusion:
#After creating dummy variables. The best model is p.lm.2 model (predictors = clone2 , clone3 and response = growth rate).
#It has the lowest AIC score and best r squared value. This tells me that best indicator of growth rate is if
#daphnia is clone2 and/or clone3

#Conclusion:
#After creating dummy variables. The best model is p.lm.2 model (predictors = sample , extract and response = count).
#It has the lowest AIC score and best r squared value. Also pvalue for F test was significantly low.
